# John 

**Name:** John B.

**Age:** 48

**Position:** Director of Research for the College of EPS

**Skills:** Very experienced in his area, has been Principle Investigator for several high profile projects, currently leads a Â£1 mio. EPSRC funded project including also commercial partners 

**Level of knowledge:** He is aware that there are EPSRC requirements for Open Access and research data management, however he has never written a data management plan and details of the policies are unclear to him. 

**Experience:** He is experienced in leading data driven projects. As these projects involve several partners, his project team adheres to internal basic guidelines for consistent file naming and central storage and data exchange. They also agreed on central documentation for the main variables used to create the data.

**Needs:** Project internal data management is under control, however he needs help with making already existing workflows EPSRC compliant.

**Motivation:** Most of his engagement is driven by trying to achieve funder compliance.

**Barriers:** Mostly a lack of time and the fact that RDM and OA are not his highest priorities in this project. Sharing some of the data collected might also cause tensions with some of the commercial project partners.
